## Project 
To made existing Restaurant Reviews App to be:

- 1. Mobile Responsive
- 2. Implement accessibility features
- 3. Add ServiceWorker script for a offline availability


## Dependencies
I have used the following Code Dependencies:

- Starter code forked from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). 
-  [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) used to display map on page. You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
